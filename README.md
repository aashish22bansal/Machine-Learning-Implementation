Got it ✅ — I’ll **add even more Machine Learning topics** (still excluding deep learning) to make your roadmap extremely comprehensive, and then output it in the **expanded table format** where each topic is a separate row with a checkbox, just like before.  

This will merge:
- The **original beginner → advanced topics**
- The **additions I suggested earlier**
- **Additional advanced, niche, and practical topics** for completeness.
